- Add wayland support
- make a function/constant for everything (for future wayland support)
- use the icccm and ewmh extensions
- reparenting and decorations
- cfg reloading
- make everything that is not completely neccessary an extension (kinda done i think but imma keep it here)
- decide wheather to use the generic types or using the backend's types for typing
- docs and docstrings
- use the sequence thing in x11 backend
- always use checked function for xcb to catch errors
- make all scripts be bash
- use Xvideo (x plugin, not porn) and implement a Video class for the x backend (?)
- errors
- properly redraw
- make animations work; maybe with a composer?
- more backends (e.g. one for windows/macos?)
- free floating
- custom config paths
- more tiling methods
- scrolling!! (i wanna try it out)
- maybe use layouts for tiling, might also make it possible to resize arbitrary windows on the fly
- fix typing for extension resolves
- schedule the reply getting functions to run after everything else is done, so that the async is more acceptable
- split this file into more categories lol
- threaded drawing?
- gpu acceleration?
- export c api to extensions
- auto setup extensions?
- optimization for certain backends on extensions?
- apps!!
- gui stuff in general is pretty lacking, so i should add some more
- composition
- config extensions like widgets? (is this a good idea?)
- maybe render with cogl & coglpango for text?
- gestures? xinput supports only 2 so i will prolly have to impl my own :/
- reference all sources iv used in the code
- finally implement the fucking atoms
- theming events
- more stuff that themes support lol (roundness and shit)
- update x11's image.set (see extensions/share.py)
- typing for the cffi functions
- fix gctx typing
- impl unloaders for whatever extensions need them :P
- more tests
- make text be able to be render for a specific pixel height
- make gwindow auto add an event listener for win specific events that triggers the global ones
- theming gui overrides
- organize this shit into categories
- fix all mypy errors
- add mypy to the github actions
- benchmarks
- support transparency
- standalone running of widgets and such
- cli arguments
- cli help
- cli -d --display argument
- remote debugging
- custom cursor (<http://uw714doc.xinuos.com/en/man/html.X3xlib/XCreateFontCursor.X3xlib.html>)
- make image.set for x11 be fast
- move everything to massert (check ``bandit -r .``)
- add parameter names for typed cffi functions (see ``xcb_cffi.lib.func.__doc__``) ((only idea i have for how to do this is reading the source file))
- fix x shm images not always being redrawn (no idea why)
